# nepi_app_obstacles

Obstacle localization app for NEPI Engine.

The app consumes a depth map published by any NEPI depth map source, splits the
returns into ground and obstacles, groups the obstacle returns into discrete
obstacles, and publishes each one with its pixel box, range, azimuth and
elevation.

## ROS interface

All names are rooted at the device namespace, `<base>/app_obstacles`.

Published:
- `<base>/app_obstacles/obstacles` — `nepi_app_obstacles/Obstacles`, the obstacle
  list only; it carries no images, so subscribing to it is cheap
- `<base>/app_obstacles/obstacles_depth_map` — `nepi_app_obstacles/ObstaclesDepthMap`,
  the same per-cycle header fields plus the two 32FC1 segmentation range images
  (ground and obstacles), published back to back with the obstacle list. Pair the
  two on `source_topic` + `source_timestamp`. Local namespace only, no `all`
  fan-out, so the images are never broadcast to consumers that did not ask.
- `<base>/app_obstacles/obstacles/status` — `nepi_app_obstacles/ObstaclesStatus`, latched
- `<base>/all/obstacles` — the same `Obstacles` message, collective fan-out
- `<image namespace>/obstacles_image` — overlay image, one per active source
- `<base>/app_obstacles/controls/status` — `nepi_interfaces/ControlsStatus`

Subscribed (each also available under `<base>/all/obstacles/…`):
- `enable`, `set_auto_select_enable`
- `set_source_topic`, `set_source_topics`, `add_source_topic(s)`, `remove_source_topic(s)`
- `set_max_process_rate`, `set_max_image_pub_rate`, `set_image_pub`, `set_use_last_image`
- `set_full_screen`, `set_show_sources`, `set_show_ground`, `set_show_obstacles`
- `set_ground_transparency`, `set_obstacles_transparency` — `std_msgs/Float32`,
  0.0 fully opaque through 1.0 invisible, clamped

`set_use_last_image` is the overlay alignment control. On, the image publisher
renders the obstacle data on the buffered source frame whose stamp matches the
frame that data was derived from, so the boxes and the scene agree at any source
rate. Off, it renders on the newest frame and the boxes lag by the process
latency.

The ground overlay is painted a flat green over the whole ground segment; the
obstacles overlay stays colourized by range. Both standalone segmentation
renders (`ground_depth_map_image`, `obstacles_depth_map_image`) stay colourized
by range regardless — they are depth map renders, not overlays.

Sources are discovered by their `nepi_interfaces/DepthMapStatus` publisher, so
any NEPI depth map is a valid input with no configuration.

## Deploy

```bash
./deploy_app.sh
```

Requires `NEPI_REMOTE_SETUP` to be set (`0` local, `1` remote).
